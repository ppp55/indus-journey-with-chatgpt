# **Chapter 3 — The World of Indus Signs: Shapes, Patterns & Structure**

The Indus script contains around **400–450 unique signs**,  
depending on how scholars group or split variants.  
These signs appear across seals, tablets, pots, copper plates,  
and pottery graffiti from more than a thousand sites.

Although the script is undeciphered,  
we can still study its **structure**, **shape patterns**,  
and **internal relationships**.  
Students can learn a great deal from how signs are arranged  
and how they combine with strokes and modifiers.

This chapter introduces a **shape-based and position-based** approach,  
encouraging curiosity without making definitive claims.

## **3.1 What Is a “Sign”?**

A **sign** is a distinct visual element that carries meaning  
within a writing or symbol system.

In the Indus script, signs include:

- animals (unicorn, bull, fish-like shapes)  
- jars and vessels  
- human-like figures  
- geometric shapes  
- arrows and loops  
- strokes and numerical lines  

A sign may be:

- pictorial (resembles a real object)  
- abstract (geometric or symbolic)  
- composite (two or more shapes combined)  

Some signs are simple; others are elaborate,  
such as complex fish, double loops, or stacked symbols.

## **3.2 Sign Categories: Prefix, Core, Suffix**

Researchers have observed that Indus inscriptions often follow  
a **pattern**:

### **Prefix → Core → Suffix**

- **Prefix signs** are usually small symbols  
  (strokes, jars, loops, small animals).

- **Core signs** are the central or major sign of the inscription  
  (unicorn, fish-type symbols, tall jar, bow-like shapes).

- **Suffix signs** are short markers  
  (final strokes, pot-like endings, short zigzags).

This structure is seen consistently in many seals.

This chapter trains students to identify possible segments  
within an inscription.

---

## **3.3 Why This Structure Matters**

Even if we cannot read the signs,  
the **order** in which they appear provides clues:

- certain signs *always* occur in first position  
- some signs never appear at the end  
- some signs repeat with variations in the middle  
- strokes tend to modify other signs  
- jar-like shapes often appear near the beginning  

This tells us that the Indus script follows **rules**,  
and rules imply a system of communication  
rather than random decoration.

## **3.4 The Shapes Themselves**

Indus signs include:

### **Geometric**
- circles  
- rectangles  
- triangles  
- loops  
- cross-shapes  
- chevrons  
- parallel lines  

### **Pictorial**
- fish-like forms  
- animal heads with horns  
- jar shapes  
- tree-like symbols  
- human figures  

### **Modifiers**
- short strokes  
- dots  
- numerals  
- small attached marks  
- separators  

Recognising shapes helps in grouping signs  
and noticing patterns across inscriptions.

---

## **3.5 How Teachers Can Use Shape-Based Learning**

Students can:

- sort signs by similarity  
- compare strokes across seals  
- identify repeating motifs  
- map prefix–core–suffix positions  
- observe slight variants of the same sign  
- sketch signs to understand structure  

This is a visual learning method, suitable for all age groups.

> and abstract geometric shapes?  
> What does this suggest about the users of the script?

## **3.6 Pattern Recognition: Seeing Order in the Signs**

When students analyse many seals, they begin to notice:

- certain signs always appear at the **start**  
- some core signs repeat across sites  
- some groups of signs appear together frequently  
- strokes modify the meaning or quantity  
- jar-like shapes often cluster in specific positions  

This introduces students to **pattern recognition**,  
a fundamental skill in both mathematics and reading.

Pattern recognition also helps:

- compare inscriptions  
- identify families of signs  
- separate variants from distinct symbols  
- understand structural rules in the script  

Even without decipherment,  
the script behaves like a **coherent system**.

## **3.7 Shortness and Density of Information**

Indus inscriptions are typically:

- **short**  
- **dense**  
- **structured**  
- **symbolically loaded**

The average inscription length is **3–7 signs**.  
This suggests:

- compact information transfer  
- roles for administration  
- ritual or household identifiers  
- possibly profession markers  
- tags attached to goods or storage units  

Short inscriptions allow:

- quick stamping  
- repeated use  
- memorability  
- consistent identity markers  

This mirrors modern systems like:

- QR codes  
- logos  
- monograms  
- caste marks  
- religious symbols  
- trade guild marks  

The Indus script may have operated similarly  
as a **compact, multi-purpose information tool**.

## **3.8 Variation Without Chaos**

One striking pattern in the Indus script is that variation exists,  
but it is **controlled**, not random. Examples:

- fish signs appear in different curves or lengths  
- jar signs vary in size but keep their shape  
- loops may appear single or double  
- strokes vary in number but follow position rules  

This mixture of consistency and variation  
is a hallmark of **living symbol systems**.

It suggests:

- artistic freedom for seal-makers  
- regional variations  
- functional or ritual contexts  
- possible evolution over centuries  

Students learn that ancient scripts, like languages,  
allow room for creativity within structure.

## **3.9 The Role of Modifiers (Strokes and Dots)**

Many inscriptions contain **strokes**:

- single  
- double  
- triple  
- sometimes four or more  

Strokes may serve as:

- numerical indicators  
- classifiers  
- qualifiers  
- variants of the main sign  

Repeated strokes appear across seals, tablets, and pottery.  
They are one of the most consistent elements  
of the Indus script’s structure.

Dots or tiny marks also appear, perhaps representing:

- quantities  
- separators  
- phonetic modifiers  
- ritual significance  

We cannot be certain,  
but stroke-modifier patterns teach students  
to observe **hierarchy within symbols**.

## **3.10 Signs Across Regions and Time**

The Indus civilisation extended across a wide geography:

- Harappa (Punjab)  
- Mohenjo-daro (Sindh)  
- Dholavira (Kutch)  
- Kalibangan (Rajasthan)  
- Rakhigarhi (Haryana)  
- Lothal (Gujarat)  
- Many smaller sites  

Despite this vast area,  
the script shows **remarkable uniformity**:

- similar signs  
- similar ordering  
- similar stroke patterns  
- similar seal shapes  

This suggests:

- strong cultural cohesion  
- shared administrative traditions  
- long-distance communication networks  

Even when variants appear,  
the underlying structure remains stable.

## **3.11 Composite Signs and Stacked Structures**

Some Indus inscriptions contain **composite signs**:

- two fish-signs combined  
- loops attached to primary signs  
- stacked jar shapes  
- pairs of geometric elements  

These may represent:

- complex ideas  
- combined identifiers  
- multi-layered roles  
- ritual or clan associations  

Recognising composite signs  
helps students understand how meaning  
might be built using **sign combinations**.

## **3.12 Beyond Decipherment: Cultural Insights**

Even though the script is undeciphered,  
its structure and motifs reveal aspects of the civilisation:

- emphasis on order and standardisation  
- symbolic richness  
- connections between trade, ritual, and identity  
- visual thinking and cognitive sophistication  

This approach encourages students to appreciate the civilisation  
without assuming or asserting unproven linguistic claims.

## **3.13 Using the Script in the Classroom**

Teachers can create activities like:

- grouping signs by shape  
- mapping prefix–core–suffix structures  
- comparing modifiers  
- sketching simplified seal designs  
- building imaginary inscriptions  
- discussing what symbols might have meant  

This builds:

- pattern recognition  
- cultural imagination  
- visual literacy  
- critical thinking  
- pluralistic interpretation skills
