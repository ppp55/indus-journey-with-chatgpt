# **Chapter 9 — How to Look at an Indus Sign:  
Seeing Through Layers, Lines, and Learning Traditions**

Before decipherment comes **seeing**.  
Every tradition of writing—Sumerian, Egyptian, Chinese, Tamil, and perhaps Indus—developed not only from language, but from a discipline of **how to look**, **how to draw**, and **how to train the mind**.

This chapter introduces an essential skill for Indus studies:

# **9.1 The Art of Looking Before Reading**

Sumerian *edubba* teachers told their students:

> “Sharpen your eyes before sharpening your stylus.”

Why?  
Because reading begins with **perceiving patterns**,  
not pronouncing meanings.

Indus signs demand the same discipline.  
Before we interpret, we must learn how to **see**:

- line  
- curve  
- structure  
- orientation  
- balance  
- proportion  
- abstraction  

This “eye training” is shared by:

- engineers learning to draw lines between two points,  
- architects learning to visualise space,  
- Montessori students tracing letters in sand,  
- artists learning the shapes beneath forms,  
- epigraphers studying signs through layers.

---

## **9.2 Signs as Points, Lines, and Curves: The Engineering Analogy**

Engineering drawing begins with:

- **placing points**,  
- **joining points with straight lines**,  
- **adding arcs**,  
- combining them into **shapes**,  
- then into **systems**.

A seal-carver does exactly this.

Every Indus sign—no matter how complex—can be broken into:

- **points of change**  
- **straight strokes**  
- **curves**  
- **angles**  
- **joins**  

For example:

- Fish signs → long axis + angled tail lines  
- Jar signs → circle/oval + vertical stand  
- Horned heads → curve + prongs + vertical base  
- Three-leaf motifs → central spine + symmetrical curves  
- Gate-like signs → horizontals + verticals like architectural sketches  

This engineering-like view helps students reconstruct signs  
as **designed objects**, not mysterious symbols.

---

## **9.3 Montessori Principle: Build the Whole from Simple Parts**

Maria Montessori observed that children understand complex forms  
only after mastering:

- straight lines,  
- loops,  
- arcs,  
- strokes,  
- basic geometric shapes.

Indus symbols reflect the same underlying logic:

- strokes → modifiers  
- loops → containers  
- arcs → animals or heads  
- triangles → blades, leaves, or architectural peaks  
- circles → jars, eyes, solar motifs  

This suggests that the cognitive system used by Indus scribes  
was grounded in **basic forms → composite forms → symbolic forms**.

Visual grammar begins here.

---

## **9.4 Indus Signs as Layers: Pictorial, Abstract, and Functional**

Many Indus signs work on **multiple layers at once**:

### **Layer 1 — Pictorial Form**
Some signs resemble:

- animals (fish, bull, unicorn, elephant)  
- tools (harrow, comb, bow)  
- vessels (jar, vat, churn)  
- plants or leaves

### **Layer 2 — Abstract Geometry**
Even animal-like signs reduce to geometry:

- triangles (horns, leaves)  
- arcs (backs, jars)  
- straight strokes (tails, modifiers)  
- dots (eyes, counts, qualifiers)

### **Layer 3 — Functional Pattern**
Indus signs also exhibit functional behaviour:

- positioned consistently  
- attract or reject strokes  
- hold the “core” position in inscriptions  
- cluster with certain families  
- resist pairing with others

Understanding all three layers helps avoid premature assumptions.

---

## **9.5 Why Background Matters: How Each Person Sees Signs Differently**

A trained engineer may see:

- load-bearing shapes,  
- architectural resemblance,  
- proportion and symmetry.

A trained artist may see:

- composition and balance.

A ritual specialist may see:

- offerings, vessels, ritual stands.

A linguist may see:

- possible semantic categories.

A child may see:

- animals or simple shapes.

This shows why pluralism is essential:

### **No single background can capture all dimensions of a sign.**

Instead, students must practice *layered seeing*  
to interpret signs responsibly.

---

## **9.6 Placing Ourselves Inside Indus Contexts**

To understand Indus abstraction, we must imagine:

- what tools they used,  
- what materials they worked with,  
- what animals they saw daily,  
- what objects dominated their craft world,  
- what architectural forms shaped their towns,  
- how ritual and economy influenced design.

This contextual grounding helps explain why signs look the way they do:

- bulls → central to agriculture and wealth  
- jars → used in ritual, storage, trade  
- fish → possibly symbolic or seasonal markers  
- geometric forms → reflecting city planning and craft design  
- strokes → universal cognitive units used across cultures

> ### **Reflection 9.1**
> Choose any Indus sign.  
> Describe it first as **lines and curves**,  
> then as **a picture**,  
> then as **an abstract form**,  
> and finally as **a functional element**.  
> How does your interpretation change at each layer?

## **9.6 Layer 1 — The Stroke Layer: The Smallest Building Blocks**

Just as the Sumerian *edubba* instructed students  
to sharpen their eyes and recognise each wedge,  
and just as engineering students learn by placing two points  
and drawing a straight line between them,  
the Indus script also begins with **elemental strokes**.

These include:

- vertical strokes  
- horizontal strokes  
- short angled strokes  
- dots  
- hooks  
- curves  

This “stroke layer” is similar to  
Montessori early-writing pedagogy:

- children draw straight lines,  
- then arcs,  
- then shapes,  
- then combine them to form letters.

The Indus scribes seem to follow the same logic:  
**start simple → combine → refine → standardise**.

This foundational layer tells students:  
even complex signs are born from simple gestures.

---

## **9.7 Layer 2 — The Shape Layer: From Strokes to Recognisable Forms**

When strokes combine in stable patterns,  
they create the **shape layer**:

- jars and containers  
- horns and crescents  
- fish-like silhouettes  
- tree-like verticals  
- composite rectangles and squares  
- tripod stands  
- abstract architectural shapes  

This layer does for the Indus script what  
engineering drawing does for structures:

> simple lines + arcs → walls, beams, supports, profiles.

Likewise, Indus signs are *abstract picturisations*  
of familiar everyday objects, animals, tools, and social symbols.

This explains why students from different backgrounds  
(perhaps engineering, art, archaeology, linguistics)  
see **different pathways into the same sign**.

Pluralistic interpretation becomes necessary  
because signs themselves are polyvalent.

---

## **9.8 Layer 3 — The Functional Layer: How Signs Behave**

A sign’s meaning may remain unknown,  
but its **behaviour** is observable.

Students can ask:

- Does the sign appear only as a prefix?  
- Does it ever appear as a suffix?  
- Does it cluster with only two or three specific signs?  
- Does it require strokes to make sense?  
- Does it appear only with the unicorn motif?  

This is similar to how an engineer examines a component:

- What is its location?  
- What forces act on it?  
- What does it connect to?  
- What is its function within the system?  

Indus signs reveal **functional constraints**  
that hint at meaning *without requiring decipherment*.

---

## **9.9 Layer 4 — The Cognitive Layer: Pattern-Making Across Cultures**

Human beings naturally:

- group signs,  
- form categories,  
- detect rhythm,  
- seek symmetry,  
- identify clusters,  
- compare visual families.

This “cognitive layer” explains why:

- fish signs look related,  
- jar signs form a family,  
- stroke-modified signs behave predictably.

Students learn that the script reflects  
shared human cognitive habits:

- classify similar forms,  
- repeat useful shapes,  
- stabilise useful sequences,  
- transmit conventions across generations.

This layer links Indus thought  
to broader human pattern-recognition traditions  
seen in Sumerian, Egyptian, Chinese, Tamil graffiti,  
and even modern design systems.

---

## **9.10 Layer 5 — The Cultural Layer: Meaning From Context**

Even when shapes survive, meanings do not.  
But *context* provides powerful clues.

Students learn to read:

- where signs appear (seals, tablets, pottery, copper plates)  
- which motifs accompany them (unicorn, bull, ritual stand)  
- which sites prefer certain clusters (Dholavira vs Harappa)  
- which signs occur only in ritual contexts  

This is similar to archaeology itself:

- a pot in a grave ≠ a pot in a kitchen  
- a symbol on a seal ≠ a symbol on graffiti  
- a stroke on pottery ≠ a stroke on a copper plate  

The Indus script must be understood in its **cultural ecosystems**,  
not in isolation.

Context does not give meaning,  
but it gives **direction**.

---

## **9.11 Layer 6 — The Abstraction Layer: Seeing Signs as Systems**

This is where your insight becomes powerful:

> “Indus signs seem to be abstracted picturizations of animals,  
> objects, human forms, including engineering architectural sketches.”

An architect sees beams and joints.  
An engineer sees forces and connections.  
A scribe sees categories and modifiers.  
A ritual specialist sees offerings and symbols.

The Indus script may reflect:

- abstraction of nature  
- abstraction of craft  
- abstraction of hierarchy  
- abstraction of ritual action  
- abstraction of identity  

By teaching students to see abstraction,  
we prepare them to understand:

- why signs repeat,  
- why proportions matter,  
- why small variations exist,  
- why clusters behave like structured “modules”.

This transforms the script  
from mysterious markings  
into a coherent **visual system**.

---

## **Reflection 9.2**  
Choose a sign you like — jar, fish, horn, strokes, loop, triangle.  
Describe how it works at **each layer**:

1. stroke  
2. shape  
3. functional  
4. cognitive  
5. cultural  
6. abstraction  

What new insights appear when you treat the sign as layered?

## **9.7 Abstraction in Ancient Symbol-Making: Removing to Reveal**

Abstraction is one of humanity’s earliest cognitive tools.

To abstract is to *remove parts of reality*  
so that a core idea becomes visible:

- A bull becomes a curved horn + hump.  
- A fish becomes a line with a forked tail.  
- A jar becomes a semicircle with a neck.  
- A human becomes a stick figure with raised arms.  
- A building becomes a few stacked rectangles.  

This is not simplification for convenience—  
it is **a deliberate act of focusing**.

Indus scribes (like Sumerian and Egyptian artisans)  
enhanced recognisability by stripping forms down to essentials:

- the “unicorn” motif is an abstracted hybrid,  
- the jar sign removes texture but preserves form,  
- the fish family reduces anatomy to silhouette,  
- composite signs merge shapes into structural motifs.

Abstraction reflects:

- what mattered to the culture,  
- what needed to be communicated quickly,  
- what was visually distinctive,  
- what could be standardised.

It is a window into ancient cognition.

---

## **9.8 Constructive Learning: The Montessori Parallel**

If abstraction is the *removal* of detail to capture essence,  
Montessori-like learning is the reverse: a *construction* process.

Children learn letters by:

- tracing simple strokes,  
- combining circles and lines,  
- building complex forms from elements,  
- moving from tactile material to symbolic thought.

This mirrors how scripts evolve:

- dots + lines → modifiers  
- curves + stems → early pictograms  
- merged forms → composite signs  
- repeated shapes → structured families

Thus, Indus signs can be viewed through two lenses:

### **(A) Abstraction Lens**
How real-world forms were *reduced* into essential marks.

### **(B) Construction Lens**
How small symbolic elements were *combined*  
into more complex, meaningful units.

Both lenses help students understand that symbol-making is a  
**two-directional cognitive process**.

## **9.9 The Designer’s Eye: Points, Lines, Curves, Systems**

Your engineering analogy deepens this chapter.

The first lesson in technical drawing:

- mark two points,  
- connect with a straight line,  
- then a curve,  
- then assemble multiple lines into a volume.

Master drawings become **systems of relations**:

- points,  
- alignments,  
- dependencies,  
- layers,  
- constraints.

Indus signs exhibit the same underlying logic:

- controlled angles,  
- consistent proportions,  
- repeated curve radii,  
- modular recombination,  
- symmetry awareness,  
- structural “balance”.

This suggests a cognitive world where scribes thought  
not only as writers, but as **designers**,  
carefully managing form, proportion, and variation.

---

## **9.10 Layered Sign Interpretation: Seeing More Than One Dimension**

Because Indus signs sit between abstraction and construction,  
each sign may contain several **layers**:

### **Layer 1 — Physical Form**
Shape, strokes, orientation, carving.

### **Layer 2 — Pictorial Memory**
Echoes of animals, objects, tools, gestures.

### **Layer 3 — Functional Role**
Prefix, core, suffix, or cluster component.

### **Layer 4 — Semantic Field (Hypothetical)**
Identity, activity, quantity, category, ritual role.

### **Layer 5 — Cultural Layer**
Shared meaning within guilds, clans, rituals.

### **Layer 6 — Epigraphic Layer**
How the sign participates in sequences, clusters, networks.

### **Layer 7 — Cognitive Layer**
How humans abstracted and reconstructed symbols.

This layered approach reflects the pluralistic philosophy  
you have built throughout the book.

---

## **9.11 Why Grouping Matters: A Multi-Parameter Method**

There is no single correct way to group Indus signs.

They can be classified by:

- **shape family** (fish / jar / geometric / animal),  
- **construction elements** (strokes + curves + merges),  
- **region** (Harappa vs Dholavira vs Lothal variants),  
- **function** (prefix / core / suffix),  
- **abstraction level** (near-real vs symbolic),  
- **complexity** (simple vs composite signs),  
- **context** (seal, sealing, tablet, pottery graffiti),  
- **frequency** (common vs rare),  
- **cluster behavior** (stable vs flexible),  
- **co-occurrence networks** (graph-based dependencies).

Your Vallam–Tanjore “Mookkan / three-stars-running” example  
shows how different grouping lenses yield different insights.

Pluralism is not confusion.  
Pluralism is *method*.

---

## **9.12 Abstraction + Construction = A Pluralistic Research Path**

By combining:

- abstraction (removing detail),  
- Montessori-like construction (building detail),  
- engineering principles (rules + variations),  
- epigraphic discipline (structure first),  
- Indus context (animal + object + geometric blends),  

students and researchers can approach the script through:

### **1. Visual Grammar**  
(How signs behave structurally)

### **2. Cognitive Archaeology**  
(How ancient minds shaped symbols)

### **3. Pluralistic Reasoning**  
(How multiple interpretations coexist)

### **4. Computational Testing**  
(How models confirm or collapse)

This approach does not claim to decipher the script.  
It prepares the intellectual soil  
in which decipherment *may one day be possible*.
