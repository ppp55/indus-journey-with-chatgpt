# **Chapter 8 — Reading Indus Signs as Visual Grammar: Form, Function & Cognitive Patterns**

The Indus script may be undeciphered, but it is far from unreadable.  
Even without knowing its language, we can learn to see how its symbols *behave*:

- how they group,  
- how they repeat,  
- how they modify one another,  
- how they imitate patterns seen in craft, counting, ritual, and identity.

This chapter introduces **visual grammar** —  
a method that respects uncertainty while training students  
to think like epigraphers, designers, and disciplined observers.

---

## **8.1 The Mental Discipline of an Epigrapher**

Epigraphers must balance:

- strict discipline (rules, structure, evidence), and  
- creative openness (multiple hypotheses).

Your reflection beautifully captures this balance:

> *In the edubba schools of Sumer, a tablet copied wrongly was destroyed on the spot.*  
> *In our own childhood, writing on slates, mistakes were wiped instantly.*  
> *Engineering design also follows this logic—standards first, variation next.*

This teaches students:

### **1. Standards Create Reliability**  
Just as an engineer follows codes,  
ancient scribes followed rules:

- stroke orientation,  
- position of prefix,  
- shape proportions,  
- alignment,  
- acceptable variants.

### **2. Variation Happens Within Rules**  
Indus seals show consistency *and* creativity:

- unicorns differ slightly,  
- jars vary in proportion,  
- strokes shift based on need,  
- regional workshops have local signatures.

Exactly like engineering or architecture:  
a bridge must meet standards,  
but each designer expresses it differently.

### **3. Bad Writing Does Not Survive**  
Just as edubba students’ errors were destroyed,  
poorly carved Indus seals may never have entered circulation.

This helps explain:

- why the script appears so uniform,  
- why errors are rare,  
- why clusters are consistent across regions.

### **4. But We Cannot Assume Too Much**  
We remain open to:

- special conditions,  
- local improvisations,  
- experimental workshops,  
- ritual exceptions,  
- learning contexts.

Pluralism keeps the field humble and honest.

## **8.2 What Is “Visual Grammar”?**

Visual grammar is the study of:

- **form** (shape, proportion),  
- **function** (what a sign *does* in the sequence),  
- **position** (prefix / core / suffix),  
- **relationship** (what signs appear together),  
- **modifiers** (strokes, dots, hooks, loops),  
- **orientation** (layout on seal, tablet, pottery).

Unlike linguistic grammar,  
visual grammar does not need decipherment.

It asks:

- *How does the system behave?*  
- *What rules does it follow consistently?*  
- *Where does it allow variation?*

This method respects the scribal discipline implied by seal-making.

---

## **8.3 Why Visual Grammar Is Better Than Guesswork**

Past decipherment attempts often start with a fixed assumption:

- “It must be Tamil.”  
- “It must be Indo-European.”  
- “It must be Sumerian-like.”  
- “It must be proto-Dravidian.”  
- “It must be family or trade names.”  

But if the assumption is wrong,  
the entire interpretation collapses.

Visual grammar avoids this trap:

- It studies the **system**, not the **language**.  
- It treats signs as **structured symbols**, not phonetic guesses.  
- It observes consistency, not speculation.  
- It lets **multiple interpretations coexist**.

This is exactly the kind of mental discipline  
needed for pluralistic Indus research.

## **8.4 How Visual Grammar Mirrors Engineering Design**

Your engineering analogy fits perfectly:

Just as design has:

- **General Conditions** (standards, constraints, rules), and  
- **Special Conditions** (site context, soil, materials, needs),

Indus writing likely had:

### **General Scribal Rules**
- prefix comes first  
- core sign central  
- strokes modify but do not dominate  
- proportion must remain stable  
- layout fixed on seal frame  

### **Local or Special Exceptions**
- regional styles  
- workshop signatures  
- ritual variants  
- learning-stage errors  
- combined motifs  

This makes the script both predictable **and** full of possibility.

---

## **8.5 Group Training and Scribal Learning in the Indus World**

We do not know if Indus scribes had formal schools,  
but we *do* know:

- sign forms are consistent across 1,500+ km  
- seal-carving requires apprenticeship  
- errors are rare  
- alignment and proportions follow rules  
- sign families remain stable over centuries  

This suggests:

### **A Culture of Careful Learning**

Even without alphabets or grammar markers,  
scribes must have passed knowledge through:

- workshops,  
- family guilds,  
- ritual specialists,  
- craft-based apprenticeships.

Just like Sumer’s edubba system,  
only well-formed inscriptions survived.

## **8.6 The Mental Discipline of an Epigrapher**

Reading any ancient script—especially an undeciphered one—requires  
**a particular kind of mental discipline**, one that resembles:

- **Edubba training** in ancient Sumer,  
- **professional engineering design**,  
- **quality-controlled craftsmanship**, and  
- **scientific humility**.

Ancient Sumerian scribal schools (edubba) expected students to:

- follow strict conventions,  
- practice correct forms repeatedly,  
- destroy tablets with errors,  
- maintain internal consistency,  
- master both copying and interpretation.

This is remarkably similar to how  
engineers, architects, and designers work today:

- follow standards,  
- check errors,  
- preserve quality,  
- innovate *within* constraints.

This analogy helps students understand that  
Indus scribes were likely trained in a similar way:

- **standard prefixes**,  
- **recognisable cores**,  
- **controlled suffixes**,  
- **shape families**,  
- **regular stroke counts**,  
- **consistent orientation**.

Even when variations appear,  
they occur **within a cultural discipline**,  
not random improvisation.

## **8.7 Variation Under Control: A Design Philosophy**

Just like engineers have:

- general conditions,  
- special conditions,  
- constraints,  
- tolerances,  
- and context-based adaptations,

ancient seal-makers and scribes also adapted signs  
to suit local styles or purposes  
**while respecting system-wide rules**.

This explains:

- why seals are visually diverse,  
- yet structurally consistent,  
- why inscriptions vary in shape,  
- yet follow positional logic,  
- why clusters differ across sites,  
- yet remain recognisable.

The Indus script behaves like a **design language**:

- flexible enough for personal style,  
- strict enough to ensure recognition.

---

## **8.8 Visual Grammar as the Bridge Between Rigor and Creativity**

Visual grammar gives students a balanced framework:

### **RIGOR**
- study prefix–core–suffix order,  
- examine modifier placement,  
- look for clustering patterns,  
- observe positional constraints,  
- compare across regions.

### **CREATIVITY**
- imagine identities (Option A),  
- imagine activities (Option B),  
- explore symbolic possibilities,  
- allow multiple parallel hypotheses,  
- build “what-if” models.

This duality mirrors how ancient scribes worked:
creativity *within* structure.

---

## **8.9 Errors, Deviations, and Scribal Freedom**

Just as edubba students destroyed flawed tablets,
Indus scribes may also have:

- erased,  
- recarved,  
- corrected,  
- or discarded imperfect seals.

But variation does not always indicate error.  
It may reflect:

- local workshop traditions,  
- personal artistic choices,  
- symbolic emphasis,  
- ritual-specific needs.

Understanding this helps students avoid  
overinterpreting every variation  
as linguistic difference.

## **8.6 Visual Grammar and the Mental Discipline of an Epigrapher**

Learning to read an undeciphered script is not only about symbols.  
It is about cultivating a **mental discipline** —  
the same discipline used by:

- ancient scribes in Sumerian *edubba* schools,  
- modern epigraphers analysing inscriptions,  
- engineers following design standards,  
- architects balancing creativity with constraints.

The *edubba* tradition is especially instructive:  

- students copied model tablets,  
- incorrect copies were erased or broken,  
- correct structure mattered more than decoration,  
- discipline created a shared visual culture.

This resonates with the Indus script:  
the marks are brief, controlled, structured —  
yet allow room for variation.

Visual grammar trains students to think like epigraphers:

- **observe before interpreting**,  
- **compare before concluding**,  
- **identify structure before meaning**,  
- **distinguish rule from exception**,  
- **accept uncertainty without anxiety**,  
- **test assumptions, not assert them**.

This is the essence of pluralistic practice.

## **8.7 Design Philosophy: Standards, Freedom, and Constraints**

Engineering design follows a familiar principle:

- **general conditions** → universal rules  
- **special conditions** → contextual adaptations

In Indus inscriptions we can see something similar:

### **Generalities**
- standardised sign shapes  
- consistent prefix–core–suffix logic  
- similar stroke patterns  
- common seal architecture  
- controlled visual proportions

### **Specialities**
- regional variations  
- artistic freedom of individual seal-carvers  
- differences between seals, sealings, and tablets  
- occasional composite or experimental forms  

This is exactly how engineering drawings,  
architectural plans, and scientific diagrams behave:  
**structured enough to recognise; flexible enough to function.**

Visual grammar allows students to appreciate this balance.

---

## **8.8 Script Variation: Regularity Without Rigidity**

If Indus communities shared a writing tradition,  
we would expect:

- a common “school” or learning environment,  
- a shared discipline of strokes and shapes,  
- basic rules followed by all users,  
- some deviations based on region, purpose, or artisan skill.

This is exactly what the archaeological record suggests:

- seals show strong consistency,  
- tablets display minor stylistic shifts,  
- graffiti marks show looser and more playful forms  
  (similar to how students today write quickly on slates or notebooks).

Such variation does **not** imply grammatical sophistication  
nor the absence of grammar.  
It reflects what you described:  
**a culture where knowledge is known, shared, and adapted —  
but not forced into a single rigid form.**

Pluralism helps preserve this nuance.

## **8.9 Visual Grammar as a Tool for “What-If” Thinking**

Visual grammar empowers students to explore  
multiple interpretive pathways:

- **What if** strokes indicate categories rather than numbers?  
- **What if** core signs represent roles or guilds?  
- **What if** suffixes indicate batches or ritual steps?  
- **What if** clusters reflect activity sequences?  
- **What if** certain signs mark special conditions  
  while others mark general conditions?

These questions do not claim certainty.  
They reflect a **computational mindset**:

- test many assumptions,  
- evaluate consistency across seal corpora,  
- discard models that fail,  
- refine models that hold.

This is analogous to PERT/CPM reasoning in engineering:  
a system of dependencies, possibilities, and branching paths.

## **8.10 Visual Grammar as a Pedagogical Framework**

For teachers, visual grammar provides:

- a non-linguistic way to teach script analysis,  
- a bridge between archaeology and cognitive science,  
- inquiry-based learning opportunities,  
- a safe approach that avoids speculative claims,  
- and an accessible entry point for students of all ages.

Key outcomes for learners:

- sharpened observation  
- appreciation of structure  
- comfort with ambiguity  
- analytical flexibility  
- respect for diverse interpretations

Visual grammar is thus not only a descriptive tool—  
it is a **thinking discipline**,  
preparing the next generation of Indus researchers  
to work with care, humility, and creativity.
