# **Chapter 7 — Reading Signs Through Clusters, Context & Pluralistic Reasoning**

Indus inscriptions do not stand alone.  
Every sign, stroke, prefix, and visual motif becomes meaningful only  
when we study how signs **cluster**, how they appear across contexts,  
and how multiple interpretive paths coexist.

This chapter builds on the foundations from earlier chapters:

- prefix–core–suffix structure,  
- positional logic,  
- stroke-based modifiers,  
- cognitive approaches,  
- pluralistic reasoning,  
- and computational “what-if” modelling.

Here we introduce a deeper idea:

# **7.1 Signs Become Meaningful Only in Clusters**

A single sign is ambiguous.  
Two signs suggest a relation.  
Three signs create a **pattern**.  
Four or more signs begin to form **clusters** or **families**.

Cluster analysis allows students to study:

- repetitions  
- co-occurrences  
- absence/presence patterns  
- combinations across regions  
- internal structure  
- stroke variations  
- merge/split variants  

This method is used in:

- modern linguistics,  
- computational modelling,  
- archaeology,  
- machine-learning classification,  
- and pattern-based cognitive science.

## **7.2 Option A Interpretation: “Clusters as Possible Names or Identities”**

Some researchers propose that short inscriptions may represent:

- **personal names**,  
- **clan identifiers**,  
- **occupational labels**,  
- or **household markers**.

Under this option, students treat clusters as:

- identity tags  
- signatures  
- group markers  
- profession indicators  
- administrative labels  

This is similar to:

- Egyptian name rings,  
- Sumerian personal seals,  
- Tamil Sangam-era hero stones with names,  
- medieval guild marks.

This approach does NOT assume phonetic decipherment.  
It allows students to imagine **identity-based readings**  
without making linguistic claims.

---

## **7.3 Option B Interpretation: “Clusters as Semantic or Activity Markers”**

Another possibility is that inscriptions represent:

- **actions**  
- **categories**  
- **ritual steps**  
- **offerings**  
- **economic instructions**  
- **inventory markers**  
- **craft specialisations**

Under this option, clusters are treated as:

- structured symbolic sets  
- multi-step representations  
- visual shorthand for activities  
- transaction markers  
- ritual-event notations  

This approach avoids naming systems  
and focuses on the **semantic** or **functional** role of clusters.

## **7.4 Integrating A & B: The Vallam–Tanjore Graffiti Example (Mookkan)**

Tamil Nadu’s Vallam (near Tanjavur/Tanjore) has graffiti signs
that have been interpreted in two ways:

### **Interpretation A (Identity-Based):**
The graffiti has been read as **“Mookkan”**,  
based on:

- the count of **three strokes**,  
- the association with **three-star-like symbols**,  
- parallels with Tamil naming traditions where  
  numerical elements appear within names  
  (Mukkan / Mookkan, Irukkan, etc.).

This matches **Option A** → clusters as identity.

### **Interpretation B (Semantic/Activity-Based):**
The same graffiti can also be read as:

- **“three-stars-running”**,  
- or **“three marks signalling movement/process”**,  
- or **“three-phase activity”**,  
- or **“three steps of a ritual or offering”**.

This matches **Option B** → clusters as semantic or functional.

### **Why This Case Is Valuable**
It shows that:

- **one cluster can support multiple plausible readings**,  
- **neither reading must be rejected**,  
- **pluralism allows both to co-exist**,  
- **cluster analysis reveals hidden structures**,  
- **context determines which reading is more appropriate**,  
- **ancient scripts may not be tied to one rigid logic**.

This is the essence of pluralistic Indus research.

## **7.5 Cluster-Based Thinking in Indus Studies**

When students analyse clusters, they ask:

- Which signs frequently appear together?  
- Which signs NEVER appear together?  
- Do stroke counts change the cluster type?  
- Do clusters follow prefix–core–suffix patterns?  
- What happens when clusters appear on long inscriptions?  
- Are clusters regionally distributed?  
- Which clusters appear only on **large seals**?  
- Which clusters appear only on **mini-tablets**?  
- Which clusters accompany the unicorn motif?  
- Do clusters change when prefixes change?  

This introduces students to:

- comparative method  
- combinatorial logic  
- pattern matching  
- structural linguistics  
- computational thinking  
- graph-based analysis  
- hypothesis evaluation  

Without imposing any single interpretation.

## **7.6 What Clustering Reveals About Indus Logic**

Cluster-level analysis helps identify:

### ✔ **Stable clusters**  
These appear repeatedly without change.

### ✔ **Flexible clusters**  
These take different prefixes or suffixes.

### ✔ **Evolving clusters**  
These appear on early seals and vanish later.

### ✔ **Regional clusters**  
Certain clusters appear only in Gujarat,  
while others appear in Punjab or Sindh.

### ✔ **Functional clusters**  
Clusters on copper plates differ from clusters on seals.

### ✔ **Ritual clusters**  
Clusters accompanying rare motifs may carry symbolic roles.

By observing these, students learn that **Indus inscriptions  
encode more than individual signs — they encode structure.**

## **7.7 Triadic Reasoning: Prefix–Core–Suffix as Cluster Logic**

Earlier chapters introduced the prefix–core–suffix model.  
Here, we reinterpret that model through **cluster logic**.

Instead of assuming:

- prefix = grammatical case  
- core = noun  
- suffix = inflection  

we consider broader possibilities:

- prefix = input / initiator / classifier  
- core = identity / emblem / dominant symbol  
- suffix = qualifier / subgroup / batch  

This is similar to how the Vallam graffiti  
carries identity + count + symbolic association simultaneously.

Cluster reasoning views the three-part structure as:

### **(A) Category → Instance → Variation**  
or  
### **(B) Guild → Agent → Batch**  
or  
### **(C) Ritual → Participant → Offering**

The structure is real—  
but its **function** need not be grammatical.

## **7.8 Clustering Across Seal Types**

Different seals show different cluster families:

- **unicorn + jar device + strokes** → a strongly repeating cluster  
- **bull + short inscription** → compact identity cluster  
- **fish signs + strokes** → numeric-symbolic families  
- **geometric core + loop suffix** → administrative cluster?  
- **human figure + short stroke** → ritual-identity cluster  

Cluster logic helps us sort inscriptions  
into functionally meaningful **families**,  
without making strong linguistic claims.

---

## **7.9 Negative Evidence: What Never Clusters**

Cluster reasoning also depends on **absence**.

Some signs:

- never appear at the end  
- rarely appear in the middle  
- appear only with specific prefixes  
- require another sign to make sense  
- cluster only with jar-like or fish-like cores  

This indicates **structural dependencies**,  
similar to tasks in a PERT chart:

- some tasks must come first  
- some must follow  
- some can run in parallel  

This is computationally testable.

## **7.10 The Role of “What If” Modelling in Indus Studies**

Most decipherment attempts fail because  
they begin with *one* assumption and refuse to leave it.

Instead, we adopt a **multi-path what-if model**, where:

- each assumption generates a pathway  
- the pathway is tested against thousands of inscriptions  
- the pathway is revised based on failure or partial success  
- no pathway is privileged without evidence  

Examples:

- **What if the script has no grammar?**  
- **What if strokes = units, not numerals?**  
- **What if signs represent roles, not words?**  
- **What if core signs encode guilds or clans?**  
- **What if suffixes signal ritual subgroups?**

Modern computing allows simultaneous testing  
of **all** these models.

## **7.11 Starting Points: Why Multiple Entry Nodes Matter**

Yajna Devam begins with a recurring tri-gram.  
But cluster-based research requires many starting nodes:

- **single-sign inscriptions**  
- **two-sign clusters**  
- **three-sign triads**  
- **regional variants**  
- **long inscriptions**  
- **sealings vs seals**  

This multi-entry approach reveals:

- missing predecessor–successor links  
- alternative structural patterns  
- frequency-based clusters  
- optional vs mandatory elements  

Just as PERT networks allow multiple parallel paths,  
Indus cluster analysis must accept many valid start points.

## **7.12 Clustering as a Bridge to Future Decipherment**

Decipherment might emerge not from  
a single dramatic breakthrough,  
but from:

- clustering of sign families  
- dependency networks  
- probability graphs  
- motif context analysis  
- computational simulation of scribal rules  

Cluster-based pluralism prepares students  
for the next generation of Indus research—  
not as passive receivers of meaning,  
but as active explorers of ancient cognitive systems.

## **7.13 The Educational Value of Cluster Thinking**

Cluster reasoning teaches students:

- to tolerate uncertainty  
- to reason across multiple possibilities  
- to integrate visual, cultural, and numerical clues  
- to evaluate assumptions  
- to revise hypotheses as evidence evolves  

This mirrors scientific reasoning  
in archaeology, linguistics, and computing.
