# **Chapter 5 — Numbers, Strokes & Mathematical Thinking in the Indus World**

The Indus Valley Civilisation is often celebrated for its  
urban planning, drainage systems, weights, and measures.  
But underlying these achievements is something more fundamental:  
**a mathematical way of thinking**.

Even though we do not have long mathematical texts from the Indus world,  
we do have:

- **standardised weights**,  
- **carefully proportioned bricks**,  
- **layout grids**,  
- **stroke-based symbols**, and  
- **structured sign sequences**.

These offer valuable clues to how the Indus people understood  
**quantity, measurement, and structure**.

This chapter explores how mathematics shaped  
the Indus script and its symbolic logic.

## **5.1 Mathematics Before Written Numbers**

Before numerals were written symbols,  
people used:

- repeated strokes  
- notches  
- tally marks  
- dots  
- bundles  
- grouped objects  

Early humans relied on **visible repetition** to express quantity.  
This tradition appears across the world and continues even today  
(e.g., tally marks for counting in classrooms).

In Indus inscriptions, strokes and short lines  
are among the most common elements,  
suggesting a deep connection between **counting** and **symbolic communication**.

---

## **5.2 Why Strokes Matter in the Indus Script**

Strokes appear frequently as:

- prefix modifiers  
- suffix markers  
- numeric-like indicators  
- qualifiers of main signs  

Their position is important:

- **At the beginning** → may classify or quantify  
- **Near the main sign** → may modify meaning  
- **At the end** → may mark specific categories or counts  

Even without knowing exact meanings,  
students can learn that **position alters function**,  
a valuable concept in linguistic and mathematical reasoning.

---

## **5.3 Bundles, Groups, and Units**

Archaeology shows the Indus civilisation used **standard units**, such as:

- cubical weights in fixed ratios  
- bricks in a proportional system (1:2:4)  
- terracotta cakes of uniform size  

This suggests a culture that understood:

- grouping  
- repeating units  
- proportion  
- measurable standardisation  

These foundational ideas likely influenced how the script developed.  
Short vertical or horizontal strokes may have represented:

- units  
- multiples  
- categories  
- measures  
- ritual counts  

Students can explore multiple interpretations without assuming certainty.

---

## **5.4 Strokes Paired With Core Signs**

In many inscriptions, a core sign (fish-like, jar-like, horned shape)  
is followed or preceded by **1–4 strokes**.

This suggests:

- **modification** of meaning  
- **classification**  
- **some form of counting**  
- **graded categories** (e.g., levels, types, intensities)

The same core sign with:

- one stroke,  
- two strokes, or  
- three strokes  

may belong to **a family of related ideas**.

This teaches students to look for **pattern families**  
rather than isolated signs.

---

## **5.5 The Visual Logic of Indus Numerals**

Even though we do not have a Rosetta Stone,  
the logic of strokes helps students understand that numbers often begin as:

- repeated marks  
- simple lines  
- minimal shapes  

Many early scripts evolved similarly:

- Egyptian → vertical lines for 1, 2, 3  
- Chinese → 一 二 三 for 1, 2, 3  
- Early Tamil graffiti → strokes for units  
- Sumerian → wedge repeats for counts  

The Indus script fits within this global tradition  
of **minimalist numerals**.

## **5.6 Standardisation: A Mathematical Signature of the Indus World**

One of the strongest arguments for mathematical thinking  
in the Indus civilisation is the remarkable **standardisation** seen across sites:

- weights follow binary and decimal ratios  
- bricks follow controlled proportions  
- seals have consistent dimensions  
- pottery forms show regulated typology  

This uniformity suggests:

- shared measurement systems  
- trained craft guilds  
- coordinated workshops  
- long-distance communication networks  

Students can learn that standardisation is not merely technical —  
it is **a cultural expression of order**.

---

## **5.7 The Role of Proportion in Signs**

Many Indus signs show **internal proportionality**:

- vertical vs. horizontal balance  
- symmetry in loops and lines  
- controlled height/width ratios  
- repeated geometric spacing  

This is especially visible in:

- fish signs  
- jar-like signs  
- square inscriptions  
- linear sequences on copper plates  

Even pictorial motifs follow a quiet mathematical discipline.

This does not mean the script encodes mathematics directly,  
but it shows how mathematical thinking shapes symbol design.

---

## **5.8 Counting and Ritual Contexts**

In many cultures, counting is not only practical  
but also **ritualistic**:

- counting offerings  
- repeating mantras  
- marking lunar cycles  
- creating symmetrical patterns  
- grouping symbolic items  

If some strokes represent:

- ritual repetition  
- ceremonial counts  
- offerings  
- cycles  

then they serve both **functional** and **symbolic** roles.

This expands student understanding of mathematics  
as something woven into daily and ritual life.

## **5.9 Strokes as Modifiers: A Cognitive Interpretation**

From a cognitive perspective, strokes act like **modifiers**,  
adding layers of meaning to the core sign:

- quantity  
- quality  
- category  
- intensity  
- relation  

This is similar to how modern languages use:

- adjectives  
- numerical qualifiers  
- linguistic classifiers  
- symbols with attached punctuation  

Students discover that **visual modifiers**  
are part of how humans organise thought.

---

## **5.10 Clusters, Sequences, and Rhythm**

Many inscriptions display a kind of **visual rhythm**:

- prefix strokes  
- core sign  
- optional suffix  
- final stroke or mark  

This rhythm teaches students that:

- writing has flow  
- symbols follow patterns  
- placement matters  
- visual order carries meaning  

This prepares their minds for later chapters  
that introduce **seal analysis** and **triadic reasoning**.

> ### **Inquiry 5.1**
> Choose any sign with strokes (1-, 2-, or 3-stroke variants).  
> How does changing the number of strokes  
> change your interpretation of the sign?  
> Why might ancient scribes have needed such distinctions?

## **5.11 Structured Sequences: Evidence of Cognitive Planning**

The Indus inscriptions consistently show planned sequencing:

- a clear starting position  
- a dominant core sign  
- modifiers placed at predictable points  
- optional closing marks  

This internal order suggests that scribes followed rules,  
passed down through training and practice.

Even if we cannot translate the signs,  
the presence of **systematic structure** confirms  
that this was a genuine writing or symbol system —  
not random decoration.

## **5.12 Why Strokes Are Key to Understanding the Script**

Strokes offer three educational advantages:

### **1. Accessibility**  
Students can easily identify strokes without prior knowledge.

### **2. Comparability**  
Strokes help compare inscriptions and recognise families of signs.

### **3. Hypothesis Building**  
Stroke patterns give clues about:

- quantity  
- classification  
- relationship between signs  

This makes strokes a foundational element  
in any pluralistic study of the script.

## **5.13 Interpreting Without Overclaiming**

This book encourages **responsible interpretation**:

We do **not** claim:

- strokes = numbers  
- specific signs = specific Tamil/Sumerian words  
- any inscription has a single known meaning  

Instead, we offer **hypotheses**:

- strokes may express quantity  
- prefixes may classify  
- suffixes may differentiate groups  
- core signs may encode identity or profession  

This balanced approach protects students  
from assuming certainty where none exists,  
while still allowing creative academic exploration.

## **5.14 Cultural Continuities: Tamil, Sumerian & Indus Thinking**

Across Tamil traditions, early forms of writing  
also used **simple strokes** for counting and marking.

Across Sumerian traditions, **repeated wedges**  
represented numbers and measures.

This does **not** prove linguistic identity,  
but highlights a **shared human logic**:

- numbers begin with marks  
- counting begins with repetition  
- symbols grow from simple shapes  

This helps students appreciate  
the universality of mathematical thinking.

---

## **5.15 Looking Ahead: Why Numbers Matter in Seal Reading**

Indus seal inscriptions often include:

- one to four strokes  
- grouped modifiers  
- repeated shapes  
- ordered sequences  

This chapter lays the foundation for later chapters  
where we analyse:

- stroke families  
- sign clusters  
- case studies of actual seals  
- triadic reflections (Indus–Sumerian–Tamil)  

Students will see how numerical thinking  
supports cultural interpretation.

> If you had to create a simple number system using only strokes,  
> how would you design it?  
> How would you differentiate 1, 2, 3, and 4  
> in a clear and efficient way?
