**Chapter 16 — Case Study 1:

How to Read a Classic Unicorn Seal (Part 1)**

This is the first practical demonstration of the 12-step Indus reading method.
Students now apply everything learned so far —
visual grammar, strokes, families, clusters, motifs, abstraction, and pluralistic reasoning.

We begin with the most iconic Indus type:

A standard Unicorn Seal with a short inscription (3–5 signs).

Since we are not using images here, the case study is written in a generic but accurate model form, based on hundreds of known unicorn seals.

16.1 Description of the Seal Used for This Case Study

A typical unicorn seal has:

Motif zone:
A unicorn facing left, with a ritual stand (object or trough) in front.

Inscription zone:
3–5 signs in a horizontal row above the animal.

For this case study, we use a generic, widely attested 4-sign configuration:

[Sign A] – [Sign B] – [Sign C] – [Strokes]


Where:

Sign A looks like a simplified jar or gate-like form

Sign B is a structured core sign (often fish-type or geometric form)

Sign C is a small modifier-like symbol

Final element = 1–3 strokes as suffix modifiers

This pattern occurs across Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, and Kalibangan.

16.2 Step 1 — Identify the Inscription Zone

We separate:

Motif: unicorn + ritual object

Inscription: 4 signs above

This prevents motif-driven guesswork.

16.3 Step 2 — Determine Direction

Unicorn seals almost always read left → right.

Thus:

A → B → C → strokes


Direction confirmed.

16.4 Step 3 — Identify Prefix Candidates

Sign A is:

small-to-medium in size

simple in structure

often a jar-like or gate-like shape

commonly found in the prefix position on unicorn seals

Thus, we classify:

A = prefix candidate

It likely indicates category, group, or context.

16.5 Step 4 — Identify the Core Sign

Sign B:

largest sign in the sequence

most visually complex

appears in the middle

stable across many seals

Thus:

B = core sign

This sign likely expresses the main identity encoded on the seal
(not a personal name in linguistic terms, but a symbolic identity or category).

16.6 Step 5 — Identify Suffix Candidates

Sign C:

relatively small

usually positioned after the core

modifies or qualifies the core sign

This suggests:

C = suffix-modifier candidate

It may represent a subcategory or role.

16.7 Step 6 — Analyse Stroke Logic

The final element is:

1–3 vertical strokes

bounded (never 5–10)

attached to the right end

This suggests:

Suffix strokes = qualifiers for classification,
not necessarily numbers.

Strokes might express:

type

level

version

ritual phase

workshop batch

Pluralistic options remain open.

16.8 Step 7 — Identify Shape Families

Now evaluate each sign:

A: jar/gate family

B: fish/geometric family (depends on seal type)

C: small postfix family (often recurring)

strokes: stroke family modifiers

Recognising families prevents misclassification.

16.9 Step 8 — Cluster Behaviour Across Seals

This 4-sign pattern:

A – B – C – strokes
occurs repeatedly on unicorn seals.

Students can now observe:

Certain prefixes often pair with certain cores.

Certain suffix-signs appear only after specific core families.

Stroke numbers tend to remain 1–3, rarely 4.

The cluster is stable across regions.

Cluster logic suggests functional meaning, not random selection.

16.10 Step 9 — Compare Across Regions

Harappa versions:

slightly sharper curves

consistent prefix A

Mohenjo-daro versions:

slightly rounder shapes

similar cluster order

Dholavira versions:

occasional substitution of C with another modifier

Conclusion:

Regional variation exists, but core structure remains stable.

16.11 Step 10 — Compare Across Mediums

Mini-tablets:

similar B and C shapes

strokes sometimes appear on top or bottom

Copper plates:

strokes sometimes carved deeper or with stylistic variation

Graffiti:

highly simplified versions of A and B

This teaches students that medium influences appearance,
not structural meaning.

16.12 Step 11 — Motif–Inscription Relationship

On unicorn seals:

The unicorn motif is highly standardized.

Many inscriptions above it follow the A–B–C–Strokes pattern.

This suggests a formalised relationship between this motif and the sign-family used.

But the same inscription can appear on non-unicorn seals,
so the relationship is associative, not deterministic.

16.13 Step 12 — Pluralistic Interpretation (Without Claims)

We can explore multiple possible readings:

Possibility A — Administrative

A = category
B = identity (guild/office)
C = subcategory
Strokes = batch/lot indicator

Possibility B — Ritual

A = ritual setting
B = ritual role
C = offering type
Strokes = ritual cycle or phase

Possibility C — Symbolic

A = clan classifier
B = clan-symbol
C = branch or lineage marker
Strokes = generation or rank

No single explanation is asserted.
Each must be tested across seals — the pluralistic method.

Reflection 16.1

Pick any unicorn seal image from online repositories.

Try to identify:

prefix candidate

core sign

suffix sign(s)

stroke count

shape family of each sign

how stable the pattern seems across other unicorn seals

This trains the student’s eye to read patterns, not meanings.

End of Chapter 16 — Part 1
16.6 Step-by-Step Structural Interpretation (Without Meaning)

Using the inscription introduced in Part 1:

[Stroke] – [Jar-like Core] – [Fish/Axis Variant] – [Suffix Stroke]


we now proceed with a structural reading.

Step A — The Prefix Candidate

The single stroke at the left:

is small,

does not attract modifiers,

appears in many seals as an opening element.

Students note:

single-stroke prefixes often mark a category,

not necessarily a number,

and often behave like a classifier announcing the inscription’s domain.

But no meaning is assigned — only function.

Step B — The Core Sign (or Core Pair)

The jar-like shape is:

proportionally larger than the stroke,

carefully carved,

stable across many seals.

This suggests:

it acts as a core sign,

likely representing a central category, identity, or conceptual field.

When followed by a fish-like sign, students ask:

Are these two cores, or

A core + functional extension?

Across many seals, jar → fish patterns behave like a stable cluster,
so structurally we treat them together as:

Core Unit (C1 + C2)

This is not linguistic parsing; it is pattern parsing.

Step C — The Suffix Stroke

The small stroke at the right:

closes the sequence,

mirrors the prefix structurally,

often acts as a qualifier or terminal modifier.

Functionally, students can say:

the inscription begins with a classifier-like stroke,

then presents a core,

then ends with a modification.

This is structural symmetry —
a feature noted widely across Indus seals.

16.7 Shape Family Identification

Students classify the middle signs:

Jar Family

distinguished by curved body + short neck

appears in administrative or ritual contexts across sites

often takes either prefix or suffix modifiers

Fish/Axis Family

long horizontal line + angled tail

numerous variants

appears frequently in short inscriptions

When a jar-family sign is followed by a fish-family sign:

the pair often forms a compound core,

a repeated cluster seen across Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.

Students must document repeated pairings
before asking interpretive questions.

16.8 Stroke Logic: What Do the Strokes Do?

Even without assigning meaning, students can observe:

1. Stroke Count:

Only 1 stroke at prefix, and 1 at suffix.

2. Stroke Placement:

Prefix stroke sits to the left.
Suffix stroke sits to the right.

3. Stroke Symmetry:

Prefix ↔ Core ↔ Suffix

This symmetrical behaviour is not random.

It suggests:

the scribes used strokes to frame the core signs,

strokes act as structural markers,

they may mark category/type distinctions.

This pattern appears on hundreds of seals.

16.9 Cluster Behaviour Across the Corpus

Comparing with other published seals, students note:

A. Jar + Fish clusters reappear

The combination is stable and widely distributed.

B. Prefix strokes attach to many jar family signs

This suggests strokes modify categories, not objects.

C. Suffix strokes appear selectively

Some core clusters require closure; others do not.

D. Unicorn motif seals often carry similar short clusters

This suggests motif–cluster association,
but not direct motif–meaning mapping.

16.10 Why This Seal Is an Ideal First Example

This seal contains:

a standard motif (unicorn),

a short inscription (4 signs),

one prefix stroke,

one suffix stroke,

a two-sign core cluster,

symmetry,

stable shape families,

clear directionality,

compact structural logic.

It exemplifies everything the student has learned so far.

16.11 What Students Can Say With Confidence

Even without decipherment:

Structure:

Prefix → Core1 → Core2 → Suffix

Families:

Jar family + Fish family

Strokes behave as framing modifiers,
not random numbers or decorations.

The cluster is stable across regions.

The inscription compresses meaning,
consistent with administrative/ritual systems.

The motif and inscription are related,
but not in a one-to-one manner.

16.12 What Students Must Not Claim

“Jar means X.”

“Fish means Y.”

“Stroke = number 1.”

“This is Tamil / Sumerian / Indo-European text.”

“Unicorn = clan name XYZ.”

These claims require evidence we do not have.

The pluralistic method protects against premature decipherment.

16.13 Reflection 16.2 — Seeing the Seal as a System

Ask students:

What structural role does each sign play?

Which patterns feel intentional?

Which elements repeat across seals?

Which questions cannot yet be answered?

What hypotheses can be tested using other seals?

This transforms the seal from an undeciphered mystery
into a cognitive artifact — a window into Indus thought.

**Chapter 16 — Case Study 1:

Reading a Classic Unicorn Seal Through Visual Grammar
(Part 3: Triadic Reflection & Pluralistic Interpretation)**

This section completes the first case study by guiding students through a triadic reasoning exercise — connecting the Indus pattern with Sumerian and Tamil cognitive parallels, without forcing linguistic equivalences.

The goal is not meaning but structured comparative insight.

16.7 Triadic Reflection: Indus × Sumerian × Tamil

Triadic reasoning is one of the core teaching tools in this book.
It helps students explore:

structural parallels,

cognitive behaviours,

pattern families,

symbolic functions,

without equating scripts or claiming decipherment.

We apply the triadic method to the three-sign inscription:

[Prefix Stroke] + [Jar-Core] + [Two-Stroke Suffix]

16.7.1 Indus Layer — A Functional Cluster

From earlier analysis:

Prefix Stroke → classifier / category marker

Jar Core → stable sign family, likely role or identity

Two Strokes → qualifier, subgroup, or second-type marker

Thus the inscription expresses a structured relationship:

Category → Core Identity → Qualifier

This is the Indus cognitive language of grouping and classification.

16.7.2 Sumerian Comparison — Order, Roles, and Modifiers

Sumerian proto-writing exhibits similar behaviours:

Prefix wedges often classified objects (e.g., type of jar or grain).

Core pictograms identified the main object or administrative item.

Numeric / additive wedges qualified quantity, class, or level.

Sumerian cluster logic often resembled:

Classifier → Main Sign → Numerical/Qualifying Wedges

Parallels to the Indus example:

Indus	Sumerian Parallel
Jar-sign	DUG / pottery signs
1–4 strokes	wedge-number families
cluster stability	proto-cuneiform listing conventions

This does not mean the Indus script is Sumerian.
It means both cultures used similar cognitive tools for organising information.

16.7.3 Tamil Comparison — Strokes, Group Logic & Thinai Thinking

Tamil traditions show deep roots in grouping and qualification:

kuṟikkai (strokes) used for marking levels, types, sequences.

thinai categories organised landscapes, people, and behaviour.

poetic structures encoded classification through pattern logic.

Early graffiti marks used strokes to modify base signs.

Tamil parallels to the Indus inscription:

Indus	Tamil Cultural Analogy
Prefix stroke	kuṟippu marking (type/category)
Jar-family core	object / role identity markers in graffiti
Two-stroke suffix	“second type” or classificatory refinement

Again, not linguistic connection—
but shared human cognitive patterns across traditions.

16.8 What Triadic Reflection Teaches Students

Triadic comparison shows that cognition precedes language.

Across all three cultures:

small strokes classify,

core signs represent stable roles,

simple structures encode complex relationships,

order reflects function.

This produces a powerful lesson:

The Indus script may be undeciphered,
but its cognitive architecture is universal.

Triadic reflection strengthens pluralism without speculation.

16.9 Pluralistic Interpretation: What the Seal Could Encode

Based on structure alone, this seal’s inscription may encode:

Possibility A — Administrative Category

prefix stroke = department / workshop

jar = product category

2-strokes = batch or type

Possibility B — Ritual Offering Sequence

prefix stroke = offering unit

jar = vessel / ritual object

2-strokes = second step or second portion

Possibility C — Identity Marker

prefix stroke = clan/group

jar = individual or official

2-strokes = rank/class

Possibility D — Commodity Labelling

prefix stroke = stock category

jar = storage item

2-strokes = quality/grade

None of these are asserted as truth.
All remain open as pluralistic possibilities.

16.10 Returning to the Motif: Why the Unicorn Matters

Most classic seals pair the unicorn motif with short structured inscriptions.

The unicorn may indicate:

ritual office,

merchant guild,

elite clan,

symbolic authority,

spiritual abstraction.

Its recurrence with jar-based clusters suggests:

a cultural association between the unicorn emblem and certain classes of objects or roles.

But the motif does not determine the inscription.
It provides context, not translation.

16.11 Final Integration: What Students Should Now Be Able to Do

By completing Case Study 1, students should be able to:

separate motif zone and inscription zone,

identify prefix, core, and suffix,

track stroke logic,

recognise sign families,

compare across cultures thoughtfully,

propose pluralistic interpretations,

avoid claims beyond evidence.

They have learned how to read structurally, not speculate.

This prepares them for more complex seals in Chapter 17.

Reflection 16.3

Choose any other unicorn seal with 3–4 signs.

Ask:

What is the prefix candidate?

What is the core sign?

What modifies it?

Does any sign resemble a known family?

Which pluralistic lenses apply (administrative, ritual, cognitive)?

What does triadic reasoning reveal when compared with Tamil & Sumerian patterns?

This reflection builds the habit of disciplined, comparative, structured observation.
