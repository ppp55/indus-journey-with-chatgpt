# **Chapter 11 — The Story of Early Numbers:  
From Clay Marks to Indus Strokes & Tamil Digits (Part 1)**

Before numerals became symbols, numbers lived in **marks**.

Early humans expressed quantity through:

- strokes,  
- cuts,  
- notches,  
- tallies,  
- repeated lines,  
- grouped objects.

This chapter traces how these simple marks evolved into:

- Indus stroke modifiers,  
- Sumerian wedge-counts,  
- early Tamil tally-marks,  
- and later written numerals.

It helps students understand that  
**mathematical thinking begins long before mathematical notation.**

---

## **11.1 The Oldest Numbers Were Not “Numbers”**

Before “2” or “3” existed as symbols,  
people used:

- **one stroke** → 1  
- **two strokes** → 2  
- **three strokes** → 3  

These were not numerals in the modern sense—  
they were **visual quantities**.

Archaeologists find such marks on:

- bones (Ishango tally bone),  
- pottery,  
- tokens,  
- early tablets,  
- cave walls.

This universal cognitive behaviour appears in:

- Sumerian proto-writing,  
- Egyptian tallies,  
- Chinese oracle logs,  
- South Indian graffiti,  
- Indus stroke-modifiers.

Numbers begin as **repetition**.

---

## **11.2 Sumerian Counting: Wedges Before Words**

The Sumerians developed numbers from **repeated wedges**:

- 𒐕 (1) → one vertical wedge  
- 𒐖 (2) → two wedges  
- 𒐗 (3) → three wedges  

Later, they used place-value and mixed-base systems,  
but the earliest stage was **simple repetition**.

This reflects the same logic seen in Indus inscriptions:

- strokes appear at the prefix and suffix positions,  
- combinations of 1–4 strokes modify core signs,  
- short inscriptions often contain nothing but strokes.

Both systems began with **visual quantities**.

---

## **11.3 Tamil Traditions: Strokes Before Digits**

In ancient Tamil practice,  
illiterate people marked quantities using **strokes**:

- |  → 1  
- || → 2  
- ||| → 3  
- X (four strokes combined) → 4  
- \|/ (bundled strokes) → 5  

This tradition survives in:

- old market tallies,  
- cattle marks,  
- potter’s marks,  
- temple accounting.

Tamil numerals evolved much later,  
but the earliest “writing” of numbers was **pure visual repetition**.

This parallels Indus usage remarkably:

- both use strokes as basic units,  
- both attach strokes to other symbols,  
- both use stroke clusters as modifiers.

---

## **11.4 Indus Strokes: The Missing Link in Early Number Logic**

Indus inscriptions frequently contain:

- 1 stroke  
- 2 strokes  
- 3 strokes  
- 4 strokes  

These are placed:

- as **prefixes**,  
- as **suffixes**,  
- next to **core signs**,  
- sometimes by themselves.

Even without deciphering meaning,  
students can see that:

### **Strokes modify meaning.**  
They “add something” to the core sign.

### **Strokes are controlled.**  
We almost never see more than 4.

### **Strokes follow position rules.**  
Usually left or right of the main symbol.

### **Strokes create families.**  
A sign + 1 stroke,  
A sign + 2 strokes,  
A sign + 3 strokes  
form a clear structural series.

This behaviour matches early counting traditions globally.

## **11.6 Why Early Humans Used Strokes for Numbers**

Before numerals existed, the human mind relied on **visible repetition**.

Across cultures:

- a single mark = 1  
- two marks = 2  
- three marks = 3  
- four marks = 4 (sometimes crossed as 5)

This appears in:

- Upper Paleolithic bones  
- Sumerian tallies  
- Egyptian early numerals  
- Chinese oracle bone signs  
- early Tamil marks  
- Indus stroke signs

Why strokes?

Because strokes are:

- quick to draw  
- easy to repeat  
- impossible to confuse  
- universally understood  
- independent of language

This is why children even today count with sticks, pebbles, or lines.

Indus scribes used the same cognitive shortcut.

## **11.7 Strokes in the Indus Script: A Visual Mathematics**

In Indus inscriptions, strokes appear:

- before core signs  
- after core signs  
- as clusters  
- as modifiers  
- as family markers  
- in rhythmic patterns

These strokes may have expressed:

- quantity  
- repetition  
- classification  
- grouping  
- ritual counts  
- administrative categories

Even without deciphering meaning,  
students can learn that strokes *behave* numerically.

For example:

- one stroke → simplest category  
- two strokes → second category  
- three strokes → an intensified or higher grouping  
- four strokes → rare, marking special contexts

Indus strokes show a **controlled rhythm**,  
suggesting system-wide conventions.

## **11.8 Tamil Counting: A Cultural Parallel Without Overclaiming**

Tamil culture preserved early counting systems through:

- tally marks (kurikkai)  
- ritual marks  
- palm-leaf bookkeeping  
- children’s slate exercises  
- early trade records

In Sangam-era references and traditional practices,  
we find:

- **ōr** → one  
- **irandu** → two  
- **mūnru** → three  
- **nālu** → four

And visually:

- Ⅰ  
- Ⅱ  
- Ⅲ  
- Ⅳ  

Exactly like universal stroke-based systems.

This does **not** prove the Indus script is Tamil.  
Instead, it shows that *human counting traditions converge.*

Tamil tallying helps students appreciate  
how strokes function as **practical numerals**.

---

## **11.9 Did Indus Strokes Always Mean Numbers?  
A Pluralistic View**

We cannot assume:

- “three strokes = the number 3”  
- “one stroke = the number 1”

Strokes may also represent:

- levels  
- types  
- stages  
- subgroups  
- offerings  
- identities  
- supervisor marks  
- ritual phases  
- workshop codes

Pluralism means **we allow all possibilities**  
and check each one against multiple inscriptions.

For example:

- A jar sign + 3 strokes might mean  
  “third kind of jar,”  
  not “three jars.”

- A fish sign + 2 strokes might mean  
  “category B of the fish family,”  
  not “two fish.”

This protects against oversimplification.

## **11.10 Patterns That Suggest Number-Like Behaviour**

Even without knowing “meaning,”  
we can detect **mathematical behaviour**:

### **1. Bounded Variants**
Most core signs have 1, 2, 3, or 4-stroke versions — never 10 or 12.

### **2. Ordered Sequences**
Strokes typically increase from left → right  
or from top → bottom.

### **3. Controlled Repetition**
A sign rarely repeats strokes randomly.

### **4. Positional Sensitivity**
Changing the position of strokes  
(prefix vs suffix)  
changes the cluster.

### **5. Rare High Counts**
4-stroke signs are rarer, suggesting special significance  
(as in many early counting traditions).

These are clues for students to observe without forcing meaning.

## **11.11 Numbers Hidden in Craft, Ritual & Storage**

Archaeology shows that Indus society needed counting for:

- grain storage  
- measuring trade goods  
- warehouse management  
- taxation or redistribution  
- ritual donations  
- household recording  
- construction ratios  
- brick production (1:2:4)

Thus, strokes need not represent abstract mathematics —  
they could be **applied counts** used daily.

Even a short inscription like:

`prefix-stroke + core-sign`

may encode:

- “batch 2,”  
- “group 3,”  
- “type 1,”  
- “unit 4,”  
- or another simple classification.

> If you were an Indus scribe,  
> how would you represent “three kinds” vs “three items”?  
> Would you use the same strokes or different ones?

## **11.6 Early Tamil Number Thinking: Strokes, Groups & Poetic Counters**

Tamil cultural traditions preserve some of the oldest  
South Asian number concepts through:

- **thinai** (landscape categories),  
- **kuṟippu** (marking/indication),  
- **ettu ezhuthu** principles of structuring sound and meaning,  
- **pattuppāṭṭu** poetic numeration,  
- **grammatical counting in Tolkāppiyam**,  
- **ancestral stroke-based number marks in pottery graffiti**.

Before formal numerals developed,  
Tamil ancestors used:

- **straight strokes for 1, 2, 3, 4**,  
- **bundled marks for larger counts**,  
- **paired strokes for duality**,  
- **curved strokes for specific ritual tallies**,  
- **simple shapes for categories** (“kind”, “set”, “group”).

This parallels the Indus logic:

- minimal strokes  
- grouped strokes  
- prefix strokes modifying a core sign  
- suffix strokes adding specificity  

The two traditions do **not** imply direct linguistic identity,  
but do reflect **shared human cognitive patterns** in early numeration.

## **11.7 Sumerian Counting: Wedges, Tallies & Clay Accounting**

Before Sumerian cuneiform became a full script,  
it existed as:

- **tokens**,  
- **tallies**,  
- **wedge-based numbers**,  
- **bundles representing goods**.

Sumerians used:

- vertical wedges for 1  
- repeated impressions for quantity  
- circles and cones to mark types  

These combined into a proto-numerical accounting system  
that gradually became writing.

Across Sumerian, Tamil, and Indus contexts we see:

### **Shared Features**
- strokes → counts  
- repetition → quantity  
- position → category  
- shape → classification  
- short sequences → compact meaning  

These similarities arise from **human needs**,  
not necessarily from cultural contact.

## **11.8 Why Early Mathematics Is Always Visual**

Long before arithmetic became symbolic,  
mathematics was:

- **seen** as marks,  
- **stacked** as tallies,  
- **grouped** as bundles,  
- **arranged** as lines and dots,  
- **felt** as clay impressions.

This visual mathematics:

- trains the eye,  
- builds proportional thinking,  
- teaches grouping,  
- strengthens structural memory.

Indus seals display this visual mathematical intelligence:  
3–4 strokes are never random;  
they behave like carefully placed qualifiers.

Tamil and Sumerian traditions echo the same cognitive pattern:  
structured marks → structured thought.

---

## **11.9 Strokes as “Thinking Tools” Rather Than Numbers**

This book does **not** claim that strokes in Indus inscriptions  
always represent numbers.

Instead, students learn that strokes can express:

- **quantity**,  
- **class**,  
- **rank**,  
- **subgroup**,  
- **sequence**,  
- **ritual cycle**,  
- **intensity**,  
- **qualification**,  
- **association with a core sign**.

This pluralistic approach avoids narrow interpretations  
and encourages cognitive flexibility.

## **11.10 Early Mathematics in Daily Indus Life**

Archaeology suggests Indus communities used mathematics in:

- town planning  
- standardised brick ratios (1:2:4)  
- weight systems  
- storage units  
- craft workshops  
- architecture  
- crop measurement  
- long-distance trade  

Their writing system naturally reflects the same logic:

- consistent proportions in signs  
- repeated patterns  
- visual symmetry  
- predictable ordering  
- controlled variants  

Mathematics was not separate from life—  
it **was life**.

---

## **11.11 Toward a Pluralistic Number Logic**

We do not know:

- if the Indus script encoded numbers directly,  
- if strokes always meant quantity,  
- if signs mapped to spoken numerals,  
- if the system was phonetic or non-phonetic.

But we **do** know:

- strokes behave consistently,  
- their placement is meaningful,  
- families of signs modify each other,  
- short inscriptions compress information,  
- patterns mirror early Sumerian and Tamil traditions.

Thus, students can adopt a **pluralistic number logic**:

### **Possibility A — Strokes = Numbers**  
(1, 2, 3, 4)

### **Possibility B — Strokes = Qualifiers**  
(type, class, grade, level)

### **Possibility C — Strokes = Ritual cycles**  
(steps, offerings, phases)

### **Possibility D — Strokes = Administrative markers**  
(batch, category, inspection count)

Each model can be tested against inscriptions  
without insisting on a single answer.

## **11.12 Reflection:  
How Do You Think With Strokes?**

Choose any 2–4-stroke pattern on a seal.

Ask yourself:

1. Could it be quantity?  
2. Could it be category?  
3. Could it be ritual count?  
4. Could it be administrative grouping?  
5. Which interpretation is most consistent across seals?  
6. Can multiple interpretations coexist?

This exercise teaches students **how to think**,  
not what to think.
