# **Chapter 6 — The Logic of Prefix–Core–Suffix in Indus Inscriptions**

One of the most important observations about the Indus script  
is that many inscriptions follow a consistent **three-part structure**:

### **PREFIX → CORE → SUFFIX**

This pattern appears across seals, tablets, pottery graffiti,  
and copper plates.  
It suggests that the script used a *rule-based* system  
similar to how languages and symbol systems organise information.

This chapter introduces students to this structure  
as a cognitive tool for analysing inscriptions.

---

## **6.1 What Is a “Prefix” in the Indus Script?**

A **prefix** is a sign placed at the beginning of an inscription.  
Common prefix signs include:

- strokes (1–4 lines)  
- small jar-like shapes  
- short loops  
- simple geometric marks  
- small auxiliary symbols  

Possible functions:

- classifiers  
- quantifiers  
- markers of group or category  
- introductory indicators  
- signs of rank or identity  

Not all inscriptions have prefixes,  
but many do — and they appear **before** the core sign.

---

## **6.2 The Central or “Core” Sign**

The **core sign** is the main symbol of an inscription.  
It is usually:

- the largest  
- the most detailed  
- placed in the central position  
- repeated across many seals  

Examples include:

- fish-like forms  
- jar and stand motifs  
- horned-head shapes  
- geometric composite signs  

The core sign may represent:

- identity  
- craft or profession  
- clan symbol  
- ritual association  

Even though undeciphered,  
its central placement suggests primary importance.

---

## **6.3 The Suffix Position**

The **suffix** appears at the end of inscriptions:

- small strokes  
- short diagonal marks  
- tiny pot-like shapes  
- geometric finals  

Possible functions:

- subgroup marker  
- completion marker  
- ritual qualifier  
- numerical specificity  
- administrative category  

Suffixes are not as common as prefixes,  
but when they appear, they seem intentional.

---

## **6.4 Why Prefix–Core–Suffix Matters**

Even without knowing meanings,  
students can learn a lot from **structure**:

- Writing systems use **order** to convey meaning.  
- Position changes the function of a sign.  
- Visual grammar precedes linguistic understanding.  
- Symbolic systems can be analysed by pattern alone.  

This shifts the educational focus from  
“deciphering a language” to  
“thinking like an ancient reader.”

---

## **6.5 Examples of Common Prefix Patterns**

Students can recognise patterns such as:

- **1 stroke + core**  
- **2 strokes + core**  
- **3 strokes + core**  
- **jar-like prefix + core**  
- **loop + core**  
- **miniature sign + core**  

These patterns are found across seals from:

- Mohenjo-daro  
- Harappa  
- Dholavira  
- Lothal  
- Rakhigarhi  

Prefix patterns help classify inscriptions  
into meaningful groups.

> ### **Reflection 6.1**
> Think of a modern system (traffic signs, emojis, abbreviations).  
> How does *position* change meaning?  
> Does order affect clarity?

---
---

## **6.6 Core Signs in Structured Sequences**

The core sign usually sits between prefix and suffix.  
It is the **anchor** of the inscription.  
Students can study core signs by looking at:

- size  
- symmetry  
- repeated appearances  
- pairing with specific prefixes  
- pairing with specific suffixes  

Some core signs appear in **families**,  
such as fish-type signs (with short/long tails),  
or jar-type signs (with variants in height).

This helps identify how the script groups meaning.

---

## **6.7 Multi-Core Inscriptions**

Some inscriptions contain **two or more core-like signs**,  
suggesting:

- compound identities  
- combined roles  
- ritual pairings  
- merged symbolic categories  

For example:

- two fish signs side by side  
- two geometric symbols combined  
- stacked composite designs  

These inscriptions reveal that  
the Indus script was flexible enough  
to encode **complex symbolic units**.

---

## **6.8 Suffix Families and Their Possible Roles**

Suffixes often appear as:

- small strokes  
- short diagonal marks  
- tiny squares or pots  
- a single loop or notch  

They seem to:

- classify  
- refine  
- specify  
- distinguish  

Suffixes may relate to:

- quantity  
- subgroup  
- series  
- ritual context  
- administrative category  

Students can explore why two inscriptions  
with the same prefix and core  
might differ by a single suffix.

---

## **6.9 Spatial Logic in Indus Writing**

Unlike modern left-to-right scripts,  
Indus inscriptions show:

- stable **left-to-right order** on seals  
- top-to-bottom order on some mini-tablets  
- structured alignment across seal impressions  

This tells us:

- scribes consistently followed an orientation  
- directionality mattered  
- order was taught and learned  

Spatial reasoning is part of writing.

---

## **6.10 The Framing Effect of Seal Architecture**

The square shape of seals creates a natural frame  
for the prefix–core–suffix structure.

The script is arranged:

- horizontally across the top  
- sometimes vertically on copper plates  
- occasionally in short stacks on small tablets  

The animal motif below acts as an **anchor**,  
balancing the inscription visually.

Understanding seal architecture  
helps students infer how ancient scribes  
balanced aesthetics with function.

---

> ### **Inquiry 6.1**
> Choose any seal (from textbooks or online references).  
> Try to identify which sign is the prefix,  
> which is the core, and whether a suffix is present.  
> What patterns do you notice?

## **6.11 Assumptions and the Logic of Interpretation**

Every approach to the Indus script begins with an assumption.  
Some assume:

- it is linguistic,  
- or proto-linguistic,  
- or purely symbolic,  
- or administrative,  
- or ritual–identity based,  
- or a mix of many functions.

The challenge is **not** that assumptions are wrong—  
but that we rarely examine how they shape our interpretation.

This book adopts a **pluralistic method** precisely because:

- different assumptions lead to different readings,  
- different readings reveal different insights,  
- insights help us understand the limits and strengths  
  of each interpretive path.

Pluralism is a *cognitive tool*, not a claim of certainty.

---

## **6.12 What If the Script Lacked Grammar?**

Modern scholars often project expectations from  
well-developed scripts like Brahmi, Akkadian, or Egyptian.

But what if the Indus script existed at an earlier stage of writing?

What if:

- there were **no case markers**,  
- no inflections,  
- no grammatical structures as we understand them,  
- but a **highly developed spoken language** behind it?

This places the script in a category similar to  
**early Sumerian proto-writing**, where:

- signs encoded *categories*, not sentences,  
- quantities were marked but not syntactically organised,  
- administrative identity preceded linguistic grammar.

This is *not a claim*, but a **what-if lens**  
students can use to understand ancient thinking.

---

## **6.13 What If Prefix–Core–Suffix Is Not Linguistic at All?**

Instead of grammar-like structure, the sequence may represent:

- **input → item → qualifier**  
- **category → identity → subgroup**  
- **ritual → participant → offering**  
- **guild → individual → batch**  

This means that the three positions may represent  
**functional logic**, not linguistic grammar.

Modern computing helps us evaluate such what-if scenarios  
by testing correlations across thousands of inscriptions.

---

## **6.14 Learning from Short, Medium, and Long Inscriptions**

We see inscriptions of different lengths:

- **1-sign inscriptions**  
  → Pure category? Pure identity? Pure emblem?

- **2-sign inscriptions**  
  → A category + identity?  
  → Identity + qualifier?

- **3-sign inscriptions**  
  → The famous “tri-gram” inscriptions analysed by Yajna Devam.  
  → Could represent stable combinations  
    (prefix, core, suffix triads).

- **4–6 sign inscriptions**  
  → Indicate a more elaborate set of relationships.  
  → May show missing elements (predecessor/successor inference).

- **7+ signs**  
  → The rare extended sequences offer  
    the *full framework* of what was possible.

By comparing across lengths,  
students can infer **what elements are optional or mandatory**  
without requiring decipherment.

## **6.15 A Computational Thinking Analogy: PERT / CPM**

Just as engineers use:

- **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)**  
- **CPM (Critical Path Method)**  

to map dependencies in a project,  
we can map dependencies among Indus signs.

For example:

- Some signs *always* precede others.  
- Some *never* appear together.  
- Some appear only when another sign is present.  
- Some signs “wait” for a specific predecessor.

This is identical to:

- **predecessor tasks**,  
- **successor tasks**,  
- **parallel paths**,  
- **optional nodes**  
in project planning.

This analogy helps students understand  
how computational modelling can clarify structural patterns  
even when meanings are unknown.

---

## **6.16 The Tri-Gram Approach and Its Limits**

Yajna Devam’s approach starts with a single recurring  
**three-sign sequence**  
and builds hypotheses around prefix–core–suffix roles.

But this is only one *starting node*.

A pluralistic method asks:

- What if we start with a *different* tri-gram?  
- What if we start with *single-sign distributions*?  
- What if we start with *suffix-only inscriptions*?  
- What if we start with *frequency rankings*?  
- What if we use *graph theory* to discover clusters?  

Modern computational tools allow us to test:

- multiple starting points,  
- multiple dependency networks,  
- multiple hierarchical models,  
- multiple what-if structures.

Pluralism prevents premature closure.

## **6.17 Future Research: Multi-Path “What If” Modelling**

The next generation of Indus research could include:

- **Monte Carlo hypothesis testing**  
- **multi-path dependency graphs**  
- **machine-learning prefix/suffix clustering**  
- **automated detection of structural families**  
- **simulation of ancient scribal rule systems**  

Students learn that ancient scripts should not be  
“decoded” with one hypothesis,  
but **explored through many pathways**,  
each evaluated for consistency and pattern integrity.

---

## **6.18 The Purpose of Structure: Teaching Students to Think**

The prefix–core–suffix model is not a claim about language.  
It is a **thinking tool** that helps students:

- see order where others see randomness,  
- reason with incomplete evidence,  
- evaluate multiple hypotheses,  
- understand the role of assumptions,  
- use computational frameworks for ancient problems,  
- approach the script with humility and curiosity.
